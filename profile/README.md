# Welcome to Callstack Incubator

This is a place where we're pushing the boundaries of what's possible with React Native.

## Areas of Focus

- **Artificial Intelligence**: From AI-powered CLIs to performance optimizations, here's what keeps us busy in the React Native ecosystem.
- **Developer Experience**: Cross-platform development is great. We want to make you even more productive by bringing new languages to the React Native ecosystem.
- **Performance**: There's always room for improvement. We're always looking for ways to make React Native faster and more efficient.
- **New Platforms**: React Native is a "learn once, write anywhere" framework. We're working on new platforms to keep that promise.
