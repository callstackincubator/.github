# Welcome to Callstack Incubator

This is a place where we're pushing the boundaries of what's possible with React Native.

## Areas of Focus

- **Artificial Intelligence**: We're building AI-powered tools and intelligent automation for the next generation of mobile applications.
- **Developer Experience**: Cross-platform development is great. We want to make you even more productive by bringing new languages to the React Native ecosystem.
- **Performance**: There's always room for improvement. We're always looking for ways to make React Native faster and more efficient.
- **New Platforms**: React Native is a "learn once, write anywhere" framework. We're working on new platforms to keep that promise.

## Motivation

> The React Native ecosystem moves fast, and new technologies bring both opportunities and challenges.
> At Callstack, we're dedicated to pushing technical boundaries and solving hard problems. We build the tools today that *you* will need tomorrow.
> ~ Mike Grabowski, CTO
